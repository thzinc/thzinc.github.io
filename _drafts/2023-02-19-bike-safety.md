- why?
  - I love biking
  - But infrastructure is not great
  - Riding on the road can be fraught, but I've managed to ride safely with a combo of gear and behavior
- Gear
  - Bike
    - Front-facing light
    - Rear blinker
    - Frame light
  - Helmet
    - Wear a helmet
      - Protects you mostly from your own mistakes
      - Better than nothing in other situations
    - Helmet light
  - High-viz shirt â€“ Orange or yellow
- Behavior
  - Take the lane
    - Ride center-of-lane
    - Ride in such an obvious place that a driver cannot plausibly say they didn't see you
    - Ride in such a way that you will cause substantial damage to a driver who hits you
  - Be annoying; take up space
  - Hand signals
  - Solidarity with pedestrians
    - You're a quick dismount away from being a pedestrian yourself
    - Bikers and pedestrians are usually at a disadvantage to drivers
    - If you're at a crossing/intersection, use your position in the road to increase pedestrians' visibility to drivers
      - e.g., at left turns when a ped is crossing, wait in the intersection until the ped is out of the crosswalk

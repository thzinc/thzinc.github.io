title: Hair light
---

While most of the focus at the Supercon is on the SAO, I wanted to have a little something extra. I admire cosplayers and wearable-makers like OddJayy, GeekMomProjects, etc., but I definitely am not up to committing to their excellent level of fit and finish. However, I found that my transparent TPU filament acted as a light conduit and I thought it would be fun to make a light for my ponytail.

With some crude testing, I found that I could comfortably fit about a 4cm cylinder in my ponytail. This was enough room to comfortably fit a CR2032, some LEDs, and a little bit of wiring into an assembly that shone light through TPU filaments.

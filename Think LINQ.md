"Think LINQ" is a short series of posts I wrote in 2012 because I was enamored with the iterator pattern and its relatively-recent generic implementation within [.NET Framework 2.0][docs-ienumerable]. I really enjoy the way that the iterator pattern enables the composition of programs. LINQ never really took off the way that Microsoft had pushed it initially, but the supporting libraries around it are some of my favorite examples of good API design.

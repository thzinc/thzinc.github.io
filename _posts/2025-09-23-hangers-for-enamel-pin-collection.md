After receiving this year's [Project for Awesome](https://www.projectforawesome.com/) perks, which included a "Magic Banana Loca" enamel pin, I realized I had a handful of other pins I collected over the years. Since I have a nice art display board, I designed some cleated hangers to display my pins.

I wanted a snug friction fit on the 1.2mm Â±0.1mm shaft of the pins, so I included a 5mm cavity with four slightly-compliant arms around a nominal 1mm open space.

I did end up needing to print these with supports for the 45Â° overhang, but otherwise printing a dozen of these was very easy.

My art board is a little more full now! ðŸ˜Š

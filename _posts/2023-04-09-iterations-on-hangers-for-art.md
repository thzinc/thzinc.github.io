I've been slowly iterating on designs to hold art on my cool, new display board. I haven't settled on anything yet, but here are several of my attempts so far.

## Compliant clip mechanism

This series of iterations is a clip mechanism meant to pinch the postcard. I had a hard time designing and printing a clip that would pinch with enough strength to hold the card in place when air moved gently through the room.

## Bottom and edge supports

I didn't measure anything for this design and went by intuition instead. My intuition was way off. This didn't work out for the postcards, but I did use the bottom support as a hook to hang a tchotchke from its chain.

I printed the vertical supports in two parts with the intention of glueing them together, but the design was so far from working that I skipped it entirely.

## Magnet and metal

I bought a bunch of 1/8 inch (~3.2mm) cylindrical magnets to experiment with, so I incorporated them into a cleat. I'm using some M2 nuts that I have a lot of to attach the postcards.

My wife is a talented and prolific knitter with a yarn stash that rivals my own nerdy maker supply. She uses an IKEA KALLAX unit to organize her yarn and really liked the pressed bamboo BULLIG boxes she saw at the store. However, the boxes are designed with smooth-headed bolts with round nuts on the inside of the box. The smooth head of the bolt is important because the box needs to be able to slide in and out of the shelf without catching, but that means the end of the bolt is protruding on the inside of the box.

![Side-by-side close-ups of product photo comparing smooth head to protrusion; The bolt protrudes about 5-6mm inside the box](/assets/bullig-box-bolt-config.jpg)

Fortunately, the box is designed with enough tolerance to accommodate an extra ~15mm within the KALLAX shelf, so I offered to design and print some runners to allow the bolt to be inserted with the smooth head inside the box and still allow the outside to slide smoothly in the shelf.

![Close-up photo of runner press-fit over the round nut; The runner is a trapezoid that is about 6mm tall to completely cover the bolt and has a 30mm by 15mm footprint on the side of the box](/assets/bullig-box-bumper-closeup.jpg)

These boxes have 12 bolts each, so I printed a whole bunch for the three boxes my wife needed. I think the came out fantastically and still maintain the look of the box while keeping the inside smooth.

title: Designing a Corsi-Rosenthal air filter box for my garage workshop

It's been over a year since I last wrote about [building an air filter for my garage workshop][post], but I'm finally making progress toward designing and building my own [Corsiâ€“Rosenthal Box][crbox]. I recently received a nice miter saw and decided to try my hand design and building with [US dimensional lumber][lumber], since its relatively ubiquitous and comparably cheap.

Using some inexpensive 2x4s, 3-inch #9 screws, and some leftover MDF or plywood (haven't decided yet), I'm planning to build a box that supports the same HVAC filters I use in my home. That way, I can buy the filters in bulk and use them in multiple places.

While I don't love working in [US customary units][units], I'm designing for the materials I can access, so everything's in inches! ðŸ¥´ This design is intended to work with a very nice exhaust fan with a sealed motor.

I'm looking forward to executing on this plan!

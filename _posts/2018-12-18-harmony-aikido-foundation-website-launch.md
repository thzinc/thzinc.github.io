[Harmony Aikido Foundation][hafusa] is a nonprofit dedicated to teaching self defense to women and girls. I got involved with the nonprofit after my friend JT Tam recruited my wife and then me to join in his vision to help women defend themselves against acts of violence. Our work needed a website, and we soon connected with the talented [Rachel Atmadja][rachel] to develop a strategy for our online presence and design a beautiful site. Rachel and I worked out a six-week project plan where she handled all user interface and user experience work and I coded the responsive site. We debuted the site at an annual banquet for students, alumni, and families of Harmony Aikido.

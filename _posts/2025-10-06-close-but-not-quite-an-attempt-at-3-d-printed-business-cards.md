I wanted to make something I could give out at maker meetups and conferences, so I thought it would be fun to design and 3D print a "business" card. I really like my [find me](/find-me) design, and I wanted something that would be easy to fit in my wallet, so I decided to use the [ISO 7810 ID-1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810), which is the standard that nearly every credit card and most identification cards are constrained to.

![Diagram of card design with with annotations of specific dimensions; The card body is 85.6mm x 53.98mm with 3.175mm radius rounded corners. The design is centered around the text "daniel@thzinc.com" with callouts indicating "daniel", "@thzinc", "thzinc.com", and "daniel@thzinc.com" as the relevant parts of my identity. There is a side view that shows the text is 0.1mm thick sandwiched between the card body that is 0.7mm thick in total.](/assets/3d-printed-business-cards/design.png){:.invertable}

I went through 7 iterations, and while attempts 3 and 7 were passable, none of them felt quite good enough to hand out at a meetup. In the iteration 7, I attempted a full plate with 11 cards and only 3 were without major defects.

## Iterations 1 through 7

{% include annotated_image.html tile_sources = "/assets/3d-printed-business-cards/cards.dzi" annotations = page.cards alt = "Grid of 3 columns by 7 rows comparing each of the 7 printed attempts"%}

## Examples of the defects in iteration 7

{% include annotated_image.html tile_sources = "/assets/3d-printed-business-cards/failures.dzi" annotations = page.failures alt = "3 cards showing defects of various kinds"%}

Nice little brain teaser involving number base conversion ðŸ˜„

> ## [Interview question of the week](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/talent-without-working-hard-is-nothing-cristiano/)
>
> This weekâ€™s question:
> **Spreadsheet programs often use the [A1 Reference Style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/numeric-columns-and-rows#the-a1-reference-style) to refer to columns. Given a column name in this style, return its column number.**
>
> Examples of column names to their numbers:
>
> ```
> A -> 1
> B -> 2
> C -> 3
> // etc
> Z -> 26
> AA -> 27
> AB -> 28
> // etc
> AAA -> 703
> ```

## My solution

At it's core, this is a conversion from base-26 with a custom set of digits to a base-10 number.

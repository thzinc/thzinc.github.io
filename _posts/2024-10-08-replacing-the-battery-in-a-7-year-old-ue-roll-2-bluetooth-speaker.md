title: Replacing the battery in a 7 year old UE ROLL 2 Bluetooth speaker
tags: electronics

The UE ROLL 2 wasn't made to be serviceable, but that didn't stop me.

The speaker is waterproof, and the insides show that there's both a gasket as well as glued tabs keeping the halves together. I used a putty spatula and a lot of patience to slowly and carefully pry each of the 10 tabs free.

Even being as careful as possible, there was a tiny bit of damage to the connector that mates the charging port to the main circuit board. This cracked connector did not appear to cause an issue.

In order to get to the battery, the flexible circuit board needs to be freed from its zero-insertion force (ZIF) socket. Gently raise the tabs on the bar to loosen the holder. (The holder will remain attached to the socket; don't try to remove it!)

With the flexible circuit board out held out of the way, the battery and its holder can be pulled straight out of its place. It is snugly resting on two pegs, but is not attached to the shell otherwise. Gently unplug the battery's cable from the connector on the circuit board to free the battery. The holder is just clipped around the battery.

The battery inside my device appears to be an 16mm diameter 16650 cell with a charging circuit and foam padding around it. The [replacement battery][replacement-battery] I bought is an 18650 with a charging circuit and no padding. The holder appears to have been made for an 18mm diameter battery, so the replacement fits well without any padding.

Clip the battery into the holder, plug the cable into the connector on the circuit board, and fit the excess wire into the cavity below the circuit board.

Align the two shells so that the inner connector mates with the small circuit board in the back shell. Snapping the shell shut was quite difficult. I had to use pliers (with some cardboard to prevent dents and scratches) to close each of the snaps.

I would not trust this to be fully waterproof after opening it, but it should remain reasonably resistant to the occasional splash.

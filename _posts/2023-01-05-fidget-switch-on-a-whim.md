On a whim, after someone on a Discord server shared a video of a fidget switch they printed, I decided to try a quick interpretation of the design with the materials I had on hand.

I had already designed and printed a [magnetic lapel pin for an LA Metro fare token][tweet] with some 6mm diameter magnets I'd scavenged from broken whiteboard magnets.

I oriented the two magnets in the track with the same pole facing outward, and the magnet's pole in the slider is oriented to attract to the track's poles. The magnets are super strong and the slider just "clicks" into the nearest magnet's position.

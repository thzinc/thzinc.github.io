In this case, writing tests to prove the solution was far more interesting than the solution itself.

TIL that Node did have tail recursion for a brief period, but then removed the feature. I was going to work on a fancy tail recursion implementation that supported memoization, but I wanted to stay in JavaScript for the solution.

## My solution

This is a simple iterative implementation. Very large numbers could cause undue CPU load, as well as repeated calls for similar values since there's no memoization.

I'm using the first defined value of the [sequence] to short circuit the case when `lim` is equal to (or less than) zero. (i.e., `let n = 0, v = 1;`)

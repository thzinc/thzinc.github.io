  After one very enjoyable maker meetup at Laura Kampf's _Bricks Cafe_, I found my body heat and sweat was enough to cause the tape to fail and dangle the battery around in the eye cup. After a few tricky measurements on the inside of the flared eye cup, I came up with the following mounting plate design to hot glue to the eye cup.

> I soldered the wire to a CR2032 battery holder with just enough slack to fit the holder in the side of the eye cup. I used double-sided foam tape to affix the holder to the inside wall.

After one very enjoyable maker meetup at [Laura Kampf][laura-kampf]'s _Bricks Cafe_, I found my body heat and sweat was enough to cause the tape to fail and dangle the battery around in the eye cup. After a few tricky measurements on the inside of the flared eye cup, I came up with the following mounting plate design to hot glue to the eye cup.

![Schematic of battery mount; the design is a 28 x 23.5mm rectangle with through holes in each corner for heat set inserts; callouts note the sloped thickness from 4.08mm to 5.07mm across the short edge, and a top view highlights the different radii of the side to be glue to the inside of the eye cup; a note indicates the flat side is to be mounted to the battery holder](/assets/led-goggles/battery-mount-design.png){:.invertable}

I used a couple of shallow M2 heat set inserts and some reclaimed Torx screws from an old hard drive to mount the battery holder.

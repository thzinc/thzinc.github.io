A couple years ago, I added a very bright [12VDC LED strip][adafruit] to my bike along the down tube and around the head tube. This increases my visibility at dusk and at night significantly, and illuminates the road really well as I'm riding.

I also designed and printed a battery box to run the strip off of three 18650 batteries.

</div>

The battery box printed reasonably well, but it took only seconds for the tabs to break off the cover. I just use a heavy-duty rubber band to hold the cover in place now.

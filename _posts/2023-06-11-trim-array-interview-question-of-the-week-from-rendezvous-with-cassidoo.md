There's a really simple one-liner for arrays, but what about using this with generators? (i.e., the [iterator] pattern where a length is not known until reaching the end of the iteration)

## My solution

_Written as a stream of consciousness_

First, the one-liner:

{% capture solution %}
{% include /code_kata/trimArray/solution-simple.js %}
{% include /code_kata/trimArray/tests-simple.js %}
mocha.run();
{% endcapture %}
{%- include codepen.html markup_type="haml" markup="#mocha" code_type="js" code=solution -%}

Now, let's deal with a generator. To deal with the `start` argument, we'll iterate that many times over the generator. Then to deal with the `end` argument, we'll need to keep a queue of items that is `end`-sized and only `yield` results that exceed the size of the queue. I'm pretty sure I can use [`Array#splice()`][mdn-splice] to do this with one nice function call.

[mdn-splice]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice

{% capture solution %}
{% include /code_kata/trimArray/solution-complex.js %}
{% include /code_kata/trimArray/tests-simple.js %}
{% include /code_kata/trimArray/tests-complex.js %}
mocha.run();
{% endcapture %}
{%- include codepen.html markup_type="haml" markup="#mocha" code_type="js" code=solution -%}

Yay! Splice works like I thought it would! This solution will only ever hold `end` + 1 elements in memory, which means that when iterating over a very large dataset (especially one where the length is not known ahead of iteration), it will outperform the simple solution in terms of memory use.

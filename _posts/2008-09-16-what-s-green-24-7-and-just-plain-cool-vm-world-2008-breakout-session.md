Breakout session at VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas, NV about VMware Server and its role in Raideil's fully virtualized infrastructure. I presented this session with my two partners, [Kraig van der Klomp][kvdk] and [Yves Accad][ya]. This was my first speaking engagement and it was a thrill to deliver this talk with my good friends to about 60 people.

title: "@thzinc is no longer on Twitter/X"
---

A small confirmation for any who might look for me on Twitter/X: I have deleted my account there. I enjoyed many of the interactions with people I had there, but the site has changed beyond recognition and is no longer a place where I want to be.

The [recently-observed privacy policy changes][techcrunch] slated to go into effect later this month are plenty enough reason to remove my content from use on the site.

After building the [framed display for my SAO collection][prev-post], I realized the last demo on the badge was running [Pew! Pew!][pew-pew], which isn't very interesting to look at if you're not actively playing the game. So I made a neat little "firework" animation with shifting colors in center!

<video alt="Video showing Petal Matrix display with bursts of light emitting from the center of display, trailing outward in a curve; the center of the display rotates through the rainbow from warm to cool hues" controls>

I've added the source code for this demo to my animated Petal Matrix repo.

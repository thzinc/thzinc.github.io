I love [Regular Expressions][mdn]. This might place me among a small group of people, but I have enjoyed the puzzle of figuring out the arcane incantation to match the text I'm looking for.

I've had the idea for a puzzle game that uses regex patterns for a while, but only recently found the drive to try to make it. It's not quite playable yet, but I got the core of the game's engine mostly working tonight. It feels pretty satisfying to puzzle out a pattern against a series of text input challenges.

<video alt="Video demonstration of a regexed puzzle being played; the focus is on three stacked sections: challenges, pattern input, and attempts; as the player types out a pattern and submits it, a new challenge is revealed; as the player continues to edit the pattern, the matched text is highlighted in real time; as the player makes attempts, the results of which challenges are successful and which failed are recorded" controls>

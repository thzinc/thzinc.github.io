The Orbic RC400L is a pretty cheap mobile hotspot that happens to run a version of the Android OS. It's handy to have a small device that slips into my pocket or my backpack, but the power button is very easy to press unintentionally. So I designed a case to protect the buttons from accidental presses:

Designing the case was a fun process of using my calipers to get the dimensions of the device and try my best to measure the offsets of the buttons, screen, and USB-C port. (And it led me to dig into the [Universal Serial Bus Type-C Cable and Connector Specification][usb-spec].)

This was a quick 3D design and print that solved a problem for me.

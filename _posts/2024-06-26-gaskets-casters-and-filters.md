The box was so close to being done. Just needed something to keep the filters in place, but also allow them to be easily removed. I decided on using weatherproofing gasket with adhesive backing. Now the filters fit snugly, but are still easy to remove and replace.

I also needed to be able to run the fan's power cord out from inside the box, so I Dremmel'd a rounded notch over a spot in the circle that was dinged up from starting the hole with the jigsaw.

This thing is quite heavy, so I bought some casters and now I can roll it around my shop. I'm so stoked to have a decent filter in the garage now! I plan to figure out some nice hardware to secure the fan on top, but for now it's quite stable just sitting in place.

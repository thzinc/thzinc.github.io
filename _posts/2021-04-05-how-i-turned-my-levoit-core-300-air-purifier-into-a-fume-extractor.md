For multiple reasons–my asthma, air quality, and COVID-19–I run several air purifiers throughout my home. I run a whole [Levoit Core 300 air purifier][levoit] on top of my desk, which typically is useful for collecting my cat's dander in addition to putting clean air out close to my face. However, I needed the ability to direct airflow from my soldering work into my air filter.

I was able to design and print this adapter to work with a sheet of foam with a hole to cover the inlet of the air filter and direct the airflow through the adapter. This does put extra strain on the air filter motor, so it's not something I leave in place for long periods of time. I measured the diameter of the air filter at 212 mm with some enjoyable practical geometry, and the flange fits reasonably well against the curve with a piece of foam to help improve the seal around the flange. The suction of the motor is enough to hold the foam and adapter in place without any additional hardware.

After a very busy (and pretty traumatic) several months, I've decided to drop the "daily" from [regexed]'s tagline and start publishing the puzzles I have in the queue. For now, I've decided to publish weekly Saturdays. (Midnight UTC)

The first puzzle is published and I think it's a gentle intro to the game: "[How many is that?](https://regexed.com/puzzles/1)" Give it a play and let me know how it goes! Here's my attempt:

    regexed 🗯️ #1: 2/6

I love a good use case for a reducer. Also, <abbr title="today I learned">TIL</abbr> that [`reducer` support on JavaScript `Iterator`s is available in the very newest browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator/reduce).

> **Given a list of integers representing the heights of buildings, return the maximum number of buildings that can be seen when looking from the left. A building can see another building if it is taller than all the buildings to its left.** The height of the tallest building is included in the count.

title: Announcing Budgetcraft!
date: 2013-08-27

I am working on a new project that I've dubbed [Budgetcraft][bc-site]. While it's not quite ready yet, Budgetcraft will be a budgeting and accounting tool that you will want to use. I'm building a simple but powerful budgeting tool that will help and enourage its users to win at their finances by incorporating elements of gaming into the process.

Want to level up your finances? [Get notified of the Budgetcraft launch][bc-launch] or [sign up for the private beta][bc-beta].

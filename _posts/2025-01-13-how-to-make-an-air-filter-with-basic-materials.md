[Multiple fires in Los Angeles][lafires] have put smoke and ash into the air–and it's worse than with many other wildfires because it's not just burned wood and brush. Keeping the air in your home as clean as you can make it is important to prevent getting sick with breathing problems.

If you have the option to use an air purifier with a [HEPA][hepa] filter, use it! However, using an additional filter box along with a HEPA filter can help remove particulate from the air faster and help keep your HEPA filter usable for longer.

Near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Richard Corsi and Jim Rosenthal developed and popularized the [Corsi-Rosenthal box][crbox], which is effective at filtering particulate out of the air. (Whether the particulate is airborne water droplets or smoke and ash!) The typical Corsi-Rosenthal box design requires a square box fan, four same-sized filters, a sheet of cardboard, and some duct tape. However, obtaining four filters during a time when many people are looking for the same filters can be difficult.

# Key concepts

Fortunately, there are a number of ways to build an effective filter box with fewer supplies. Here are the important ideas to think about when gathering supplies:

- A fan
  - Box fans (like [this Lasko fan][lasko]) are easy to work with because they have flat sides and can move a lot of air and they're pretty cheap
  - Fans that are 16 to 20 inches across will pair with common filter sizes
- Filters
  - General
    - The larger the filter, the easier it is to pull air through it
  - HVAC ("heating, ventilation, and air conditioning") filters
    - HVAC filters are also sometimes called furnace filters
    - HVAC filters are usually rated with a MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) rating; higher numbers catch more stuff from the air, so you get cleaner air
      - MERV 13 is usually good enough, but if you can get MERV 15 or higher, that's even better
      - 3M makes good filters, but they use their own "Filtrete" rating system. "Filtrete 1500" is usually good enough, but higher numbers are even better
    - HVAC filters come in several different rectangular sizes, written as "Width X Height X Depth" as in "20x25x1" meaning "20 inches wide, 25 inches tall, and 1 inch deep"
    - The deeper the HVAC filter, the more air can be pulled through it. For example, a 5 inch deep filter will clean more air than a 1 inch deep filter over the same time.
  - HEPA ("high-efficiency particulate air") filters
    - HEPA filters are much more dense than HVAC filters
    - HEPA filters are usually much more expensive than HVAC filters of the same size
    - A fan has to work much harder to pull air through a HEPA filter than through other kinds of filters
    - Large HEPA filters are usually difficult to find; most easily-obtained HEPA filters around the size of a sheet of paper or smaller
- Tape
  - Duct tape is ideal for this because it's soft and slightly stretchy and wide and sticks to metal, plastic, and cardboard really well
  - Packing tape can also work, but you'll want to make sure to smooth out the tape really well to cover gaps that might let air into the wrong places
  - Painters tape or masking tape can work if that is what you have available
- Cutting tools
  - A utility knife is ideal, but any blade will work
  - Scissors can work if that is what you have available
- Cardboard
  - Cardboard is used to help direct air where you want it to go: in to the filter and out of the fan
  - Almost any kind of cardboard will work

## Considerations

- When building a single-filter box, make sure there are a few inches of space between the filter and the fan. This allows the fan to better pull air through as much of the filter as possible.
- You can use a large cardboard box to "adapt" different sized filters to the fan
  - Moving boxes can be really helpful for this
- If your filter is too big, you can cover the overlap with cardboard and tape
- Plastic and wood also work if cardboard is not available
  - Use tape to cover edges and seams that might let air leak in
- Always "pull" air through a filter; "dirty" air should touch the filter and "clean" air should leave the fan

# Building an air filter box with one HVAC filter and a box fan

I have a new 20x20 box fan in its box. I will use its box to connect a 20x20 HVAC filter to the fan using duct tape. I cut holes in one side of the box for the fan and the other side of the box for the filter.

1. Carefully open the box and remove the fan

   ![Photo of a box fan to the right of its cardboard box](/assets/improvised-filter/step-1.jpg)

2. Stand the fan upright next to the box to see where to cut the hole for the fan. There should be a an inch or two of overlap with the fan to help keep the box from collapsing.

   ![Side profile of box and fan; the box is about an inch taller than the fan](/assets/improvised-filter/step-2.jpg)

3. (Optional) Measure and mark the lines for the hole to cut. On this box, the lines down the left and right sides and across the bottom were 2 inches from the edge. The line across the top was 3 inches from the edge.

   ![Photo of hand holding a right angle with the ruler set to a 2-inch depth laying on top of the edge of the box](/assets/improvised-filter/step-3.jpg)

4. Cut the hole for the fan. It's not important to have perfect lines because this will be covered by the fan and then covered with tape.

   ![Photo of utility knife plunged into the box at the top right corner](/assets/improvised-filter/step-4.jpg)

5. Turn the box over and lay the filter on top to see where to cut the hole for the filter. There should be about an inch of overlap with the filter to help keep the box from collapsing. On this box with this filter, the lines on all sides were 2 inches from the edge.

6. Cut the hole for the filter. Again, it's not important to have perfect lines because this will be covered by the filter and then covered with tape.

   ![Photo of filter propped up over box to show where the hole is in relation to the filter's edges; there is about an inch of overlapping cardboard that the filter will rest on](/assets/improvised-filter/step-6.jpg)

7. **Important** Look for the arrow on the edge of the filter. This shows the direction that the air must flow through. This arrow should point into the box and toward the fan.

   ![Photo of filter laying on top of box; the airflow arrow indicator is pointing down toward the box](/assets/improvised-filter/step-7.jpg)

8. (Optional) Use a couple of small pieces of tape to position the filter over the hole. This is helpful to make sure it stays in place while you continue to work on it.

   ![Photo of a 1-inch wide strip of duct tape over the edge of the filter and attached to the box](/assets/improvised-filter/step-8.jpg)

9. Use tape to connect the filter to the box. Cover all of the edges and press firmly to seal the tape to the box and filter. Also cover any corners of the box that are not sealed with tape.

   ![Photo of bottom right corner of box showing the filter taped down along its edges and also showing the corner of the box taped over; there is packing tape covering the bottom opening of the box that was put there by the manufacturer for shipping](/assets/improvised-filter/step-9-1.jpg)

   ![Photo of box standing with filter attached](/assets/improvised-filter/step-9-2.jpg)

10. Stand the box upright against the fan and use small pieces of tape to hold the two together.

    ![Side profile of box and fan with piece of duct tape connecting the two; it is clear that the duct tape is stretched a bit to provide a snug fit](/assets/improvised-filter/step-10.jpg)

11. Use tape around all of the edges of the fan that touch the box. Use a little extra tape over the power cord.

    ![Photo of bottom of box and fan showing duct tape over where the two meet; the power cord is a small bulge that comes out of the fan and runs under the box](/assets/improvised-filter/step-11-1.jpg)

12. (Optional) Make a shroud for the front of the fan.

    1. Roughly measure an inch or two of overlap from the edge of the fan's frame to the fan blade.

       ![Photo of hand holding a right angle with the ruler set to a 4-inch depth laying on top of fan's grille](/assets/improvised-filter/step-12-1.jpg)

    2. Cut four triangles out of cardboard that are as deep as the measure. On this fan, the triangles are about 4 inches deep

       ![Photo of hand holding a ruler at a 45° angle on the corner of a piece of scrap cardboard from the box that was cut earlier](/assets/improvised-filter/step-12-2.jpg)

    3. Lay the triangles at each of the corners of the fan and tape them down. This is intended to cover as much of the area inside the frame that does not have the fan blade spinning in it.

       ![Photo of triangles taped into place on the front of the fan; the fan is running and the majority of the "dead space" inside the fan's frame is covered by cardboard and tape](/assets/improvised-filter/step-12-3.jpg)

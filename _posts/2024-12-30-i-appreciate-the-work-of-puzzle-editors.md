I've managed to write 10 puzzles so far. The challenge for me right now is developing the habit of making time to write a puzzle. Once I'm in "puzzle editor" mode, the actual thing comes pretty easily and I enjoy the process of writing while playtesting my own attempts at the puzzle.

It's also _really_ hard not to get into yak-shaving mode and start tweaking styles and perceived quality-of-life improvements. Really trying to live in the "good enough" space and focus on the content of the game more than the presentation of it. Once it's been seen and played with, I'll have a clearer idea on what improvements to actually make.

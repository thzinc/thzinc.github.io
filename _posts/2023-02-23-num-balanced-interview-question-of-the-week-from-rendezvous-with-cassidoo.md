This one was fun to think about the minimal amount of processing needed to produce the result. In this case, the question is carefully worded to allow naive processing that's really fast.

## My solution

_Written as a stream of consciousness_

Upon first glance, I should be able to treat `(` as `+1`, `)` as `-1`, and any other character as `0` and then sum the result. However, if the sum is negative, that would mean there's more `)` than `(` in the string, so I'll probably need to take the absolute value of the sum.

{% capture initial %}
{% include /code_kata/numBalanced/solution.js %}

{% include /code_kata/numBalanced/tests.js %}
{% endcapture %}
{%- include codepen.html markup_type="haml" markup="#mocha" code_type="js" code=initial -%}

This feels pretty decent. I could rewrite it in a single line with `.reduce()` (as long as I drop the validation that `input` is a string), but it loses a lot of readability.

```javascript
const MAP = {
  "(": 1,
  ")": -1,
};
const numBalanced = (input) =>
  Math.abs(Array.from(input).reduce((sum, c) => sum + (MAP[c] || 0), 0));
```

(This uses `MAP` initialized outside of the function body in order to avoid reinstantiating the object `input.length` times.)

title: Hackaday Superconference 2024 – Day 2 - Mostly talking
---

I wanted to be present and attentive during talks, so I didn't do any programming at the conference today. I did, however, have several conversations with folks and hand out a few more [Petal Matrix diffuser covers][prev-post].

Also, I was able to slide into the surface mount soldering challenge this year! I was doing pretty well until I got to the 0201 components that are the size of grains of salt. My tweezers were sticky with flux and I lost both LEDs to bouncing off the table–never to be seen again. However, I did successfully solder every other larger component and have an 80% completed functional add-on for my badge.

I'm tinkering with some code tonight, so we'll see if I have anything worth presenting at the badge hacking ceremony tomorrow...

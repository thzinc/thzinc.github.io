I love a [Kallax][kallax] shelf: cubbies for everything and easy indexing and retrieval. In 2022, I designed and printed a set of slides to fit a stack of [tray organizers][organizers] that I use for screws and electronic components.

After crudely sketching out an arrangement that would fit 6 trays in a vertical stack, I designed an initial pair of slides in [Shapr3D]. However, because they're designed to fit within the Kallax shelf's 33cm height and my [Sovol SV02][sovolsv02]'s max print height is 30cm, I had to split the design into parts that joined with a biscuit. However, this afforded a better print orientation: back to front.

Even to this day–three years later–this remains my largest print in both volume and time. On the first attempt of the 80+ hour print, something caused a layer to shift and failed a print that was about halfway done.

I restarted the print and used the intervening time to check the fit in the shelf with the trays. Fortunately, the fit was good, so the second attempt proceeded.

About two-thirds of the way into the second print, I ran out of the black filament I was using and had to make a quick swap to a red filament I had on hand. I was worried I'd lose the print again, but the swap was successful and resulted in the fronts of the shelves being red instead of black.

The completed slides popped together with friction and are held in the Kallax shelf with screws at the top and bottom. I've enjoyed being able to pull the organizers out as needed, but keep them in a neat and easy-to-access place.

I love bikes _and_ trains, and so do a bunch of my friends at [Pasadena Complete Streets Coalition](https://www.pasadenacsc.org). There was a call for contributions on this post, and I got to share a blurb about a ride I did with a couple friends a few years ago.

> ## Pacific Electric Trail
>
> The Pacific Electric Trail is a super fun ride on a long, groomed corridor of reclaimed telegraph right-of-way. PasCSC volunteers had a great day by riding on a Metrolink train to the east end of the trail in order to ride back west. There's 21 miles of trail to ride, whether you experience it all at once or just ride sections of it. The trail intersects some north-south roads, but the crossings are pretty reasonable, and there are shopping centers and restaurants easily accessible from many of them. Make sure to plan for the sun: the trail does not offer much shade!
